ariaLevelParser
===============

A JavaScript parser to add the correct "aria-level" in all headings tags off my page to prevent the bug with JAWS 12 and 13 in Internet Explorer. Based on "
JAWS, IE and Headings in HTML5" http://www.accessibleculture.org/articles/2011/10/jaws-ie-and-headings-in-html5/
